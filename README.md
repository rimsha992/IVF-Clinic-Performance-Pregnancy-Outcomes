# IVF-Clinic-Performance-Pregnancy-Outcomes

# 🧬 IVF Clinic Performance & Pregnancy Outcomes Dashboard

A **healthcare analytics project** focused on analyzing IVF clinic performance, patient funnel metrics, pregnancy success rates, and regional outcomes using **SQL and Power BI**.
This project demonstrates end-to-end data handling: **data modeling → KPI analysis → interactive dashboard design**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Infertility and assisted reproductive technologies like IVF require **data-driven decision-making** to improve success rates and optimize treatment pathways.
This dashboard provides a **holistic view of IVF clinic operations**, patient progression, and pregnancy outcomes.

### Key questions answered:

* How many patients enter the IVF funnel and where do drop-offs occur?
* What is the overall pregnancy success rate?
* How do outcomes vary by **city, doctor, clinic branch, and age group**?
* What are the cost trends associated with IVF treatments?

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset is **synthetically generated** to simulate real-world IVF clinic data and includes:

* Patient demographics (age, city)
* Clinical milestones (consultation, diagnostics, IVF start, embryo transfer)
* Pregnancy outcome (success / failure)
* Treatment cost
* Doctor and clinic branch information

⚠️ *No real patient data is used.*

## 📊 Key Dashboard Metrics (KPIs)

* **Total Patients**
* **IVF Cycles Started**
* **Successful Pregnancies**
* **Average Treatment Cost (₹)**
* **Pregnancy Success Rate (%)**

## 🔍 Dashboard Features

### 1️⃣ IVF Patient Funnel

Tracks patient progression through:

* Consultation
* Diagnostics
* IVF initiation
* Embryo transfer
* Successful pregnancy

Helps identify **drop-off stages** and operational bottlenecks.

### 2️⃣ Pregnancy Outcome Analysis

* Success vs Failure distribution
* Percentage-based visualization
* Clear comparison of clinical outcomes

### 3️⃣ Regional Performance

* Successful pregnancies by **city**
* Identifies high-performing regions

### 4️⃣ Interactive Filters

Dynamic slicers for:

* City
* Doctor
* Clinic branch
* Age range

Enables **custom cohort analysis**.
